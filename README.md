# OOP the GO way !!

- GO does not provide classes but provide structs and functions that can operate on them (methods) .
- GO does not support constructors but instead a method can act as constructor where struct is in lowercase to make it unaccessible outside package.
- Using lowercase for struct/fields it unexport them and they are unaccessible outside package .
- State/data is represented using a struct, methods are functions acting on struct .
- Unlike Java, GO does not have access modifier public, private, protected. Visibility outside current package is controlled by capitalization .Capitalize name is exported .
